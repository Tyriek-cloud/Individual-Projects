# Individual-Projects
This is a collection of projects that I have undertaken in my free time. I will routinely include new projects that I find interesting.

This code is under the Creative Commons License unless I change the license in the future (be sure to review the license when copying code). I may also routinely
place code in the READ ME section (with explanation of code functionality) if I think it can help others with unique issues.

# Social Science Survey description:

I created an Individual Project in the Python Programming language titled "Social Science Survey." It consists of instructions for the completion of a survey as well as 9 questions that can be responded to through user input. A user can enter an incorrect or unrecognized input which will result in an error message; 
the user will then be instructed to answer with a valid answer choice. 

Please feel free to use the code when creating your own simple surveys.

# Caesars Cipher

A simple Caesars Cipher solution made in Javascript. The solution follows these instructions:
"One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount. A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on. Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on."

The code also must do the following:

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC") should decode to the string FREE CODE CAMP

rot13("SERR CVMMN!") should decode to the string FREE PIZZA!

rot13("SERR YBIR?") should decode to the string FREE LOVE?

rot13("GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT.") should decode to the string THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.

# NYPD Year to Date Arrests
Using a scatterplot, I believe that I was able to determine that many of the longitudinal and latitudinal points correlate and that arrests are concentrated near these areas. The literature would also appear to support this data.

# 2021 Analyisis of Weapons Possession in the 73rd Precinct 
Formulated a data visualization project that analyzed how race and sex were related to weapons possession in the 73rd precinct of the NYPD.

# Statsmodels Regression Analysis
Designed an OLS Regression Model to observe statistical data about car crashes and resulting injuries.
