# Individual-Projects
This is a collection of projects that I have undertaken in my free time. I will routinely include new projects that I find interesting.

For the most part, this code is open source unless I specify differently in the future (be sure to check the license as well when copying code). I may also routinely
place code in the READ ME section (with explanation of code functionality) if I think it can help others with unique issues.

# Social Science Survey description:

I created an Individual Project in the Python Programming language titled "Social Science Survey." It consists of instructions for the completion of a survey as well as 9 questions that can be responded to through user input. A user can enter an incorrect or unrecognized input which will result in an error message; 
the user will then be instructed to answer with a valid answer choice. 

Please feel free to use the code when creating your own simple surveys.

# Thank you for taking the time to read this.
